## Abstract

The use of animation can be a good alternative to
static visualizations when communicating dynamic changes. Some
approaches already represent spatiotemporal phenomena using
a polygon set for each time instant. However, these representations are static and not general enough to be applied for the
interpolation of arbitrary polygons. Furthermore, the problem
of interpolating arbitrary polygons present a set of requirements
that are not satisfied by the currently available tools. For example,
the polygons are arbitrary, and the interpolation should be
smooth and fully automatic (not requiring user intervention).
To solve this problem, we present an approach to interpolate
arbitrary polygon sets that satisfy those requirements, and that
can be used to visualize temporal changes of different phenomena
as an animation. In the proposed approach, we appropriately
divide and identify correspondences between origin and target
polygon sets. Our approach is general enough so that different
polygon division techniques can be used. We also performed a
series of experiments comparing a few different techniques and
discuss the results.
