## Abstract

As the videogame industry evolves, with more diverse and demanding players, making games becomes an increasingly complex task. Modern developers apply Games User Research (GUR) methods to make informed game design decisions based on their target audience. Traditional methods include observation, interview, and questionnaires. In order to obtain detailed user or gameplay information, complementary methods might be required. We analyze the inclusion of two affordable complementary methods, namely webcam-based eye-tracking and telemetry, along with data visualization in a playtesting routine. By developing three versions of a hardcore 2D platform game that demands multitasking abilities using different GUR methods, we were able to find that the chosen complementary methods cover a significant amount of gameplay issues. The metrics and eye-tracking data visualization provided insights about multitasking and level design. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges of evaluating prototypes regarding a more enjoyable experience when frustration is a desirable gameplay element.
