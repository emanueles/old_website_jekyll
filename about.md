I am a Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](http://portal.dc.ufc.br/) at the [Federal University of Ceara](http://www.ufc.br "UFC"), in Brazil.

My research interests include data visualization and data science.

I was one of the main developers of [VisTrails](http://www.vistrails.org) and [crowdLabs](http://www.crowdlabs.org).

I have also worked at the [Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute](http://www.sci.utah.edu) at the [University of Utah](http://www.utah.edu) with Professors [Cláudio Silva](http://vgc.poly.edu/~csilva/) and [Juliana Freire](http://vgc.poly.edu/~juliana/) (both now working at [NYU-Poly](http://www.poly.edu)) and at [Los Alamos National Lab](http://www.lanl.gov). I am also a former [fulbrighter](http://www.iie.org/Fulbright/). 

I’ve got a PhD in Computing at the University of Utah in 2010. Previously I’ve got a B.S and an M.S degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Ceara in Brazil.
